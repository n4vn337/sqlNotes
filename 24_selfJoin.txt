join another copy of a table to itself
used to compare rows of the same table
helps to display a heirarchy of data

there is outer, left and right join
left: will display all rows from left
right: all rows from right 

we use the original table and then the copy table 


select * 
from customers as a
inner join customers as a;


original -> a
copy -> a 

select a.customer_id, a.first_name, a.last_name,
		concat(a.first_name, ' ',a.last_name) as 'referred by'
from customers as a
inner join customers as a
on a.referral_id=a.customer_id;
