sorts the results of a querry in ascending or descending
by default -> we dont explicitly need to write to print in 
    in ascending order
    or alphabetically

we can directly write
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name;

or:
ORDER BY last_name ASC;


to order in descending -> add DESC
SELECT * FROM employees
ORDER BY last_name DESC;

-----
if two values are same, we can add another column on which it will be shorted 

SELECT * FROM transactions
ORDER BY amount,customer_id;

and we can add ASC and DESC too here

ORDER BY amount DESC,customer_id ASC;
