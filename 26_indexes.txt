used to find values within a specific column more quickly
mysql normally searches sequentially through a column
the longer the column, more expensive the operation is
UPDATE takes more time, SELECT takes less time

SHOW INDEXES FROM customers;


CREATE INDEX last_name_idx
ON customers(last_name);

Multicolumn INDEX
CREATE INDEX lfname_idx
ON customers(last_name, first_name);


to drop

ALTER TABLE customers
DROP INDEX last_name_idx;
