a pk from one table found in another table
used to link between two tables 

CREATE TABLE customers(
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);


CREATE TABLE transactions(
	transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    amount DECIMAL(5,2),
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);


to drop a FOREIGN key
ALTER TABLE transactions
DROP FOREIGN KEY transaction_ibfk_1;

where did we get transaction_ibfk_1 from
db name -> table -> foreign keys -> transaction_ibfk_1


to give the foreign key a unique name/ or to add once the table is created
ALTER TABLE transactions
ADD CONSTRAIN fk_customer_id
FOREIGN KEY(customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);

ADD CONSTRAIN fk_customer_id: is not required until and unless you want to specify a particular name to the constraint
