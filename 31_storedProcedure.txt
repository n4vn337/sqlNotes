DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE get_customers()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM customers;
END $$
DELIMITER ;

we temperarily change the DELIMITER from ; to $$ as the statement would end at first ; which we dont want

now we can call get_customers
CALL get_customers();
------------

to place some input parameters as well

DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE find_customer(IN id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE customer_id=id;
END $$
DELIMITER ;

call find_customer(1);


DROP PROCEDURE find_customer;
------------
sending two parameters

DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE find_customer(IN fname VARCHAR(50), IN lname VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE first_name=fname AND last_name=lname;
END $$
DELIMITER ;
