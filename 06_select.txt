how to select/querry all data from the table
SELECT * FROM employees;

to print only certain data only (columns) -> can change the order too
SELECT employee_id, last_name, first_name
FROM employees;


WHERE clause: when looking for something specific
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id>3;

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id!=3; -> not equal ! = 


to see if column is having null value or not
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date IS NULL;
