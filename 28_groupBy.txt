aggregate all rows by a specific column often used with aggregate functions
eg. sum(), max(), min(), avg(), count()

SELECT SUM(amount), order_date
FROM transactions
GROUP BY order_date;


normally using a WHERE cluase doesnt work
instead use HAVING

SELECT sum(amount), customer_id
FROM transactions
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(amount)>1 AND customer_id IS NOT NULL;
