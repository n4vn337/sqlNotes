when an event happends, do something
eg. (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
check data, handle errors, auditing tables
something you should master, really helpful


two keywords: 
BEFORE
AFTER

ALTER TABLE employees
ADD COLUMN salary DECIMAL(10,2) AFTER hourly_pay;

UPDATE employees
SET salary=hourly_pay * 2080;

SELECT * FROM employees;


CREATE TRIGGER before_hourly_pay_update
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.salary=(NEW.hourly_pay * 2080);

the above only works on update of hourly_pay
lets create one for when we INSERT

CREATE TRIGGER before_hourly_pay_update
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
SET NEW.salary=(NEW.hourly_pay * 2080);

--------------

CREATE TABLE expenses(
	expense_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    expense_name VARCHAR(50),
	expense_total DECIMAL(10,2)
);

SELECT * FROM expenses;

INSERT INTO expenses
VALUES (1, 'salaries', 0),(2,'suplies',0),(3,'taxes',0);

CREATE TRIGGER after_salary_delete
AFTER DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
UPDATE expenses
SET expense_total=expense_total-OLD.salary
WHERE expense_name='salaries';

DELETE FROM employees
WHERE employee_id=5;

SELECT * FROM expenses;


CREATE TRIGGER after_salary_delete
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
UPDATE expenses
SET expense_total=expense_total+ (NEW.salary-OLD.salary)
WHERE expense_name='salaries';
