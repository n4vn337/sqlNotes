structured querry language
used to
    create
    retrieve
    update
    delete
data from the database

two types of databases
1. relational
    resembles an excel spreadsheet -> rows and columns
    tables can form relationship with one another with the help of keys
    Sql
2. non relational
    oragnized in any format but a tables
        key value pairs
        graph data structures
    NoSql

We need DBMS -> workspace to write sql statements and work generally with our dbs
there are diff dbms' and they have very slight difference in their querry 
if familiar with one its easy to switch to another one from there
mysql, microsoft sql server, oracle, postgresql

note: no case sensitivy in mysql
